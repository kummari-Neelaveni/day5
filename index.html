            <p><pre>GST on Healthcare services & its Applicability
                To comprehensively understand the implication of GST applicability on 
                the health sector, we will broadly analyze and understand the following 
                
                Definition of healthcare service from the GST perspective;
                Exemptions available to the healthcare services;
                Taxability of GST on healthcare services.
                GST on Healthcare Service : Perspective
                In Goods and Services Tax, the healthcare service definition is covered under notification no. 12/2017- Central Tax (Rate) dated 28th June 2017. Accordingly, the healthcare service definition is simplified and explained hereunder –
                
                It is a service provided by way of treatment or diagnosis or care for
                Illness;
                Injury;Deformity;
                Abnormality; or
                Pregnancy.
                It includes service of transportation of patient to a clinical 
                establishment and from a clinical establishment (defined below);
                It doesnt include plastic surgery or cosmetic or hair transplant.
                After going through the above definition of healthcare service, 
                it is also important to understand the definition of Clinical Establishment.
                 The definition of clinical establishment is also covered under notification no. 12/2017- Central Tax (Rate) dated 28th June 2017.</pre></p>

                My focus is dedicated to listening to and addressing all patient concerns as well as answering all questions in terms patients can easily understand.
                 My core concern is the outcome of a healthier you which results in maximizing patient satisfaction using evidence based research.
                  I have always kept a premise that the patient is part of a team with valuable input as the patient is the subject expert when it comes to ones body. 
                  The patient should be heard & will be included in every health decision.
